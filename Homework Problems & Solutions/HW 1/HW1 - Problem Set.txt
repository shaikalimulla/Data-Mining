1) Identify two data sets that are publicly available online and answer the following questions for each of the two data sets:

(a)  URL of the webpage to access the data set.

(b)  Brief description of the data set, including number of objects, number of attributes, attribute types, and other relevant information.

(c)  What knowledge may be mined from this data set?

(d)  How would the knowledge be useful in some applications?

2) Check out recent KDD conferences ( http://dl.acm.org/event.cfm?id=RE329&CFID=620349577&CFTOKEN=39120347 ;, Publication Archive). Pick one paper that interests you and answer the following questions:


(a)  Conference venue (e.g., KDDâ€™15), paper title, authors, and affiliations.

(b)  What problem is addressed? Why is the problem important and challenging?

(c)  A high-level, brief description of the proposed solution (no need to include the details).

(d)  How is the proposed solution evaluated? (data sets, metrics, etc.)


3) 
Given the MAGIC Gamma Telescope Data Set (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MAGIC+Gamma+Telescope)


(a)  Write a python program that takes one command line argument i (i belongs to [1, 10]) and computes the following values for the i-th attribute of the 
dataset: N (number of objects), min, max, mean, standard deviation, Q1, median, Q3, IQR. Output all the values in a single line, separated by comma.

(b)  Generate a scatter plot using the 4th and 5th attributes. You can use any plotting tool, such as excel, matlab, gnuplot, R, python, etc. 

Name your python code as LastName_FirstName_HW1.py and your scatter plot as LastName_FirstName_HW1.pdf. Please attach the .py program file and the .pdf plot separately in the attachments section (Don't zip the files). You can ignore the text box.
